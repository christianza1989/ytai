Suno API Quick Start
Music Generation Callbacks
Powered by Mintlify

Music Generation Callbacks

Copy page

When music generation tasks are completed, the system will send results to your provided callback URL via POST request

When you submit a task to the Music Generation API, you can use the callBackUrl parameter to set a callback URL. When the task is completed, the system will automatically push the results to your specified address.
‚Äã
Callback Mechanism Overview
The callback mechanism eliminates the need to poll the API for task status. The system will proactively push task completion results to your server.
‚Äã
Callback Timing
The system will send callback notifications in the following situations:
Music generation task completed successfully
Music generation task failed
Errors occurred during task processing
‚Äã
Callback Method
HTTP Method: POST
Content Type: application/json
Timeout Setting: 15 seconds
‚Äã
Callback Request Format
When the task is completed, the system will send a POST request to your callBackUrl in the following format:

Success Callback

Failure Callback

Callback Reception Examples
Here are example codes for receiving callbacks in popular programming languages:
Node.js

Copy
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/generate-music-callback', (req, res) => {
const { code, msg, data } = req.body;

console.log('Received music generation callback:', {
taskId: data.task_id,
callbackType: data.callbackType,

message: msg
});

if (code === 200) {
// Task completed successfully
console.log('Music generation completed');

});
‚Äã
Best Practices
‚Äã
Callback URL Configuration Recommendations
Use HTTPS: Ensure your callback URL uses HTTPS protocol for secure data transmission
Verify Source: Verify the legitimacy of the request source in callback processing
Idempotent Processing: The same taskId may receive multiple callbacks, ensure processing logic is idempotent
Quick Response: Callback processing should return a 200 status code as quickly as possible to avoid timeout
Asynchronous Processing: Complex business logic should be processed asynchronously to avoid blocking callback response
Audio Processing: Audio download and processing should be done in asynchronous tasks to avoid blocking callback response
‚Äã
Important Reminders
Callback URL must be a publicly accessible address
Server must respond within 15 seconds, otherwise it will be considered a timeout
If 3 consecutive retries fail, the system will stop sending callbacks
Please ensure the stability of callback processing logic to avoid callback failures due to exceptions
Generated audio URLs may have time limits, recommend downloading and saving promptly
Pay attention to content policy compliance to avoid generation failures due to policy violations

Try it
This is an exclusive capability of V4_5. The style functionality of V4_5 has been significantly enhanced, as stated on the official website:
One of the many advantages of the new 4.5 model is its ability to accommodate more detailed style instructions. In previous models, it was necessary to prioritize specific genre and style details, but now instructions can incorporate a more conversational prompt. Previously, optimal results might have been achieved with a prompt like: ‚Äòdeep house, emotional, melodic.‚Äô Now, you can provide a prompt such as: ‚ÄòCreate a melodic, emotional deep house song featuring organic textures and hypnotic rhythms. Begin with soft ambient layers, natural sounds, and a deep, steady groove. Gradually build with flowing melodic synths, warm basslines, and intricate, subtle percussion.‚Äô
The ‚ÄòBoost Your Style‚Äô feature will significantly enhance users‚Äô ability to describe and control style. It is recommended for use.

Lyrics Generation Callbacks

Copy page

When lyrics generation tasks are completed, the system will send results to your provided callback URL via POST request

When you submit a task to the Lyrics Generation API, you can use the callBackUrl parameter to set a callback URL. When the task is completed, the system will automatically push the results to your specified address.
‚Äã
Callback Mechanism Overview
The callback mechanism eliminates the need to poll the API for task status. The system will proactively push task completion results to your server.
‚Äã
Callback Timing
The system will send callback notifications in the following situations:
Lyrics generation task completed successfully
Lyrics generation task failed
Errors occurred during task processing
‚Äã
Callback Method
HTTP Method: POST
Content Type: application/json
Timeout Setting: 15 seconds
‚Äã
Callback Request Format
When the task is completed, the system will send a POST request to your callBackUrl in the following format:

Success Callback

Failure Callback

app.listen(3000, () => {

});
‚Äã
Best Practices
‚Äã
Callback URL Configuration Recommendations
Use HTTPS: Ensure your callback URL uses HTTPS protocol for secure data transmission
Verify Source: Verify the legitimacy of the request source in callback processing
Idempotent Processing: The same taskId may receive multiple callbacks, ensure processing logic is idempotent
Quick Response: Callback processing should return a 200 status code as quickly as possible to avoid timeout
Asynchronous Processing: Complex business logic should be processed asynchronously to avoid blocking callback response
Lyrics Storage: Lyrics content should be saved to database or file system promptly
‚Äã
Important Reminders
Callback URL must be a publicly accessible address
Server must respond within 15 seconds, otherwise it will be considered a timeout
If 3 consecutive retries fail, the system will stop sending callbacks
Please ensure the stability of callback processing logic to avoid callback failures due to exceptions
Pay attention to content policy compliance to avoid generation failures due to policy violations
Lyrics content may contain special characters, pay attention to encoding handling
